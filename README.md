## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) What do you first need to know

- This repository is **NOT** an official repository offered by Fantom or other parties associeted directly with them.
- The scripts were written by the **BwareLabs** team internally for easily deploying a Fantom Read-Only Node.
- Feel free to clone the repository and contribute with your own improvements!

## ![alt text](/docs/BWARE-icon.png) What does this repository contain

This repository has 3 main parts. We recommend checking them in the following order:
- The [dockerfiles](/dockerfiles) directory - Dockerfile for the Fantom read-only node image - this is a prerequisite that makes possible the deployment of a container that represents the fantom node.
- The [fantom chart](/charts/fantom-node-deployment) directory - helm chart for deploying the Fantom read-only node - this is used to actually deploy the fantom node.
- The [prometheus](/prometheus) directory - values file for deploying a custom monitoring solution based on Prometheus and Alertmanager (integration with Slack), using the official Prometheus helm - this is used to deploy a simple monitoring solution.
